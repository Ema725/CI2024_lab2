# CI2024_lab2

in this lab we used 2 approaches, the first one is an evolutionary algorithm and the second one a RMHC

the RMHC is really fast and still gives a pretty good solution of the problem, it uses the inversion mutation seen in class.

the evolutionary algorithm with a large number of generations can outperform the RMHC and give a more accurate solution.

The EA also uses the inversion mutation and the inver over xover, and the parent selection uses a high selective pressure.
